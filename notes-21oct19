- no more vnc -> use ssh -J to connect to machines from now on

- optional: DHCP server - LISTENING ON INTERNAL NETWORK, NOT VDE_BACKBONE
 	using dhcpd (preferred) or systemd-networkd
- HW: configuration of unbound on router - responds to only DNS request from inside my private network

- if SSH is slow -> entropy is too low -> install haveged
